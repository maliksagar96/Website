    <h1>Project 1</h1>

    <p><strong>Step 1 is wonderful. I really love how any computational sciences course starts...</strong></p>
    <p>We start with the simplest of the differential equation, which is a 1D diffusion equation. And we discretize them in the simplest way possible. We are using a forward difference in time and backward difference in space. Both of them are first order approximations.</p>
    <p>It is called a 1D diffusion equation and I call it a 1D wave equation. This step is obtained in between deriving a wave equation. Where that equation becomes an equation symmetrical in space and time. This equation is not yet symmetrical in space and time.</p>
    <p>The initial condition that we gave is a square pulse. Theoretically this pulse should travel from left to right without any distortion in the shape of the equation. Whereas when we solve this equation this is getting distorted. Which is not the true behaviour of it.</p>

    <p><strong>What now?</strong></p>
    <p>What I am hoping for at this stage is that I will get answers to all my questions. I have the following questions right now.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>When I use the Maccormack method that is where I find a great solution. I was looking to transport a wave in as much of its real shape as possible. The gaussian pulse was transported successfully, sinusoidal waves also transported very easily but with a very minute defect at the start. Square waves had some trouble at the sharp edges. Out of Lax-Freidrich, Backward difference and Mccormack, Maccormach performed best.</li>
      <li>How are the schemes for time and space discretization used? When to use forward and backward scattering?</li>
      <li>How is the time intervals and x spacing considered?</li>
      <li>Why is the shape distorted?</li>
      <li>Why is this acting up if I am using a central difference method?</li>
      <li>What is Mccormack method?</li>
      <li>What decides the stability?</li>
      <li>How different schemes have different characteristics?</li>
    </ul>
